This project proposes a solution that uses machine learning techniques, specifically structural similarity and facial recognition, to detect and identify missing children in real-time. By analysing images or video frames captured from surveillance cameras or public spaces, the system can compare the captured faces with known images of missing children. It will provide instant alerts with crucial details like location, photograph, and the time of the incident, enhancing the speed of detection and increasing the chances of safely locating the child.
