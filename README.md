##  Finding Lost Child Through Structural Similarity Using ML Approach

This project proposes a solution that uses machine learning techniques, specifically structural similarity and facial recognition, to detect and identify missing children in real-time. By analysing images or video frames captured from surveillance cameras or public spaces, the system can compare the captured faces with known images of missing children. It will provide instant alerts with crucial details like location, photograph, and the time of the incident, enhancing the speed of detection and increasing the chances of safely locating the child.

## STRUCTUTAL SIMILARITY
A perceptual metric used to measure the similarity between two images. It is particularly useful in machine learning tasks involving image processing, computer vision, and image quality assessment. Unlike pixel-wise metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM focuses on structural information, which is more aligned with human visual perception.
